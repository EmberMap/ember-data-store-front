# Working with relationships

Here are some patterns we recommend to make working with relationships more predictable.

## Explicitly loading related data

Storefront provides an expressive way to load related data from your models. To get started, you'll first need to add the `LoadableModel` mixin to your models.

```js
// models/post.js
import DS from 'ember-data';
import LoadableModel from 'ember-data-storefront/mixins/loadable-model';

export default DS.Model.extend(LoadableModel, {
  comments: DS.hasMany()
});
```

### Load related data

Your models now have a `load` method that loads a relationship by name. Take a look at the following demo:

{{docs/guides/working-with-relationships/demo-1}}

When called the first time, the `load` method will return a blocking promise that fulfills once the related data has been loaded into Ember Data's store.

However, subsequent calls to `load` will instantly fulfill while a background reload refreshes the related data. Storefront tries to be as smart as possible and not return a blocking promises if it knows that it has already loaded the related data.

This allows you to declare the data that you need data loaded for a specific component, while not having to worry about overcalling `load`.

### Reload with related data

Your models also have a way to side load related data by reloading themselves with a compound document.

{{docs/guides/working-with-relationships/demo-2}}

Similar to `load`, the first call to `sideload` will return a blocking promise. Subsequent calls will instantly fulfill while the model and relationship are reloaded in the background.

## Avoiding async relationships

**Why avoid async relationships?**

We're of the opinion that many data-loading issues can be solved by avoiding async relationships.

Async relationships overload `model.get` to do both remote data fetching and local data access. Since `#get` is typically used everywhere for local data access, we find this mixing of concerns confusing, and instead opt to avoid async relationships altogether.

Sync relationships maintain the expected behavior of `#get` – returning local data – and in combination with our `Loadable` mixin, remote data fetching becomes explicit and local data access stays predictable.

**How to enforce sync-only relationships**

Follow the instructions and add the `force-sync-relationships` rule from our custom ESLint plugin to your app: [https://github.com/embermap/eslint-plugin-ember-data-sync-relationships](https://github.com/embermap/eslint-plugin-ember-data-sync-relationships)

You'll see the linting errors in your editor and console, and if you set the rule to `error`, your test suite will fail if any relationships are async.
